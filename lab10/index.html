							<p>The task was to create a button that generates

							<h2>Problems</h2>
							<p>First I had to learn how to properly do the lab,
								after that I had to figure out how to link the
								button generator to a user text input. Thankfully 
								my lab partner Donovan figured that out. After that 
								it was working pretty good but not looking really good.
								So I lifted some css code from Prof. Wes' website to make
								the chat look like a text string. I then didnt like how
								I had to always delete what I had previouly typed into
								the chatbox so I could enter something new.
								so I used Wesbot to figure out how to heave the box self 
								clear after clicking the button. But then I got annoyed
								that I couldn't press the return key on my computer to send. 
								SOoooo... I used wesbot to figure out what type 
								of event listener to make so that the function worked
								with the enter button too.

								It was looking pretty great then, but my boy friend noticed
								that if you just press return or the button, output text would
								appear even when u didnt write anything. So we spent almost 2 
								hours figuring out how to stop that. Basically, we had an "if, then" 
								statement. But the hard part was making the user input 
								stringify so that the input box was aware of what was or
								wasn't in the box. I'm a little confused on how he did it
								but the main thing was that we were putting it in the wrong order
								so when we put in a console.log nothing would show up. 
								But WE DID IT! 

								Special thanks to Phinhas and Donovan!

							<h2>Reflection</h2>
							<p> I would like to figure out how to have the user input 
								also look like it's a text sometime in the future. And I need to
								change the css formatting of the website to accomodate for the 
								changing box size not affecting other boxes!
