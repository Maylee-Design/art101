					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I feel like I understand linking files and photos pretty well after last lectures, so minor-section
						of my problems were just trying to style and go beyond the lab requirements. I also dont know how to convert 
					pngs to jpgs so I can post them on my website. I know there are online converters, but 
					I dont trust those things. Maybe I'm being dramatic.
				
				... nvm I figured it out later.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I'm having a hard time changing some of the colors. I aked wesbot but it didn't really help so I need to 
						make an appointment with my TA to figure out what I'm missing in my code. </p>
