			<h1>Lab 2 - Html and Css Starter</h1>

							<h2>Challenge</h2>
							<p>Our assignment was to write pseudocode for a game. We chose Sticks.
							</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="row2">
					<div class="minor-section2">
							<h2>Problems</h2>
							<p>Donovan had a hard time with the formatting on his website of the text. 
                We did a bunch of tweaking of the html but we eventually figured out that the CSS 
                was creating the issue. He had lifted some CSS code from W3 schools that was messing 
                everything up! We figured it out tho.
              </p>
					</div>
					<div class="minor-section3">
							<h2>Reflection</h2>
							<p>We met over discord and learned how to live share our code online and edit together.
                 We tried meeting in person but unfortunately could not. We got to talk about our cats 
                 and we thoroughly went over each pseudo code with as much detail as possible.  </p>

                    //At start, draw two hands. fingers = points. each hand has one finger displayed at start of game.
                      //Without telling player, assign “points”. at start of game, each player has two “points”.
