					<h2>Mason and Kam's Intro</h2>
					<p>My name is Mason and this is my first time programming. I like cats and I want to adopt a puppy at the end of this year.
						My name is Kam and I've a little bit of coding experience. It was a long time ago so I forgot most of it. I like spending my time drawing and staying indoors.

					<h2>Reflection</h2>

						how to reference items correctly, what div goes with what div. It's very confusing.  </p>
